			remote device and then creates a RFCOMM TTY
			device for it. The RFCOMM TTY device is returned.

			Possible patterns: UUID 128 bit as string
					   Profile short names, e.g: spp, dun
					   RFCOMM channel as string, 1-30

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed

			remote device and returns a file descriptor to talk
			 with this device.

			Possible patterns: UUID 128 bit as string
					   Profile short names, e.g: spp, dun
					   RFCOMM channel as string, 1-30

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported


		void Disconnect(string device)

			Disconnect a RFCOMM TTY device that has been
			created by Connect method.

			To abort a connection attempt in case of errors or
			timeouts in the client it is fine to call this method.

			be supplied instead of the TTY device.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
